              I found this from Elizabeth Alli at Designerup. In a nutshell, a
              design system is a collection of documents, articles, examples,
              code snippets, screenshots, design guidelines, components,
              philosophies and other digital assets for a product design
              company. for our purposes today, we will be discussing a design
              system exlusively in terms of design tokens and component
              libraries.

            Traditionally we would try to build this with something like a
            combination of ITCSS and the BEM naming convention. If we look at
            the diagram on the screen, the idea behind ITCSS is you organise
            your classes into these 7 categories, and the further down the
            triangle you get, the more specific the classes are. <br />
            ending up with something like...
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section data-transition="none">
          <img
            data-src="./dist/img/filetree.png"
            alt="filetree img"
            class="mx-auto"
            style="height: 70vh"
          />
          <aside class="notes">
            this.<br />
            Which is highly effective for small teams efficient with css and who
            are also familiar with this sort of file structure. **however** it
            is extremely time consuming. You need to set up your
            variables/design tokens, your folder structure, then break it down
            granually and set up appropriate css/scss imports. Then the real
            challenge, maintiainging it. Preventing it from becoming Spaghetti
            code, writing the documentation and keeping it up to date.

            its also fragile, as your system grows and your team changes you
            gather tech debt, it's invevitable, the adding things here and there
            to meet a deadline with every intention to clean it up later.

            What if we could just plug your design tokens into a config, and voila! ready to go?
Enter, Tailwind.
