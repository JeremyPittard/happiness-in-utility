Design Systems are great. Pre-built components allow you to scale out new features quickly while remaining on brand. 
Building design systems on the other hand can be a giant pain, especially when it needs to be utilised by a large team 
across multiple frameworks. Normally this would require a complex folder structure for your design tokens, complicated 
mixins and default styles. It can take a lot of time to get it right, and once it is, it’s fragile and messy.

Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework, Takes seconds to scaffold with no messy folder structure and (at times) painful 
naming conventions. You enter your design tokens and you’re ready to start styling your components.

Let’s look at how Tailwind can save you time when scaling out your design system. As well as how it bulletproofs your design 
and code with its utility-first approach.
